## Getting Started

### Backend Integration

Our frontend is intricately connected to the backend, which is hosted separately. The backend repository contains the serverless API code and other backend-related functionalities. To explore the backend, visit [Serverless Scratch Backend](#backend-repo-link).

### Serverless Architecture

Embracing the serverless paradigm, our app leverages AWS Lambda & API Gateway for the serverless API, DynamoDB for the database, and Cognito for user authentication. This ensures scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness. 🌐🔒💰
